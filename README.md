# Slay_The_Spire_Stats

The goal of this project is to transfer SQL queuries I made in SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) to create the csvs for my tableau visualizations to python

The resulting visualization can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/TerrenceMSlaytheSpireCardStats/CharacterWinrate?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

By moving things to python I can now easily use any data provided. So if anyone provides me with their run data I can generate the csvs with this code to visualize 
their data in the same way I have done my own.

I provided a small sample of my own runs for each character for anyone that would like to work with what I built and doesn't have access to other Slay the Spire data.
